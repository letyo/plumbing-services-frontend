The website offers professional plumbing services, including faucet replacement, pipe installation, boiler replacement, and heating system setup. Users can request services via a contact form, and submissions are sent to a Telegram bot for real-time notifications. Built with React and Node.js, it features a responsive design and smooth navigation.

This is only the backend part. You can see the frontend here: https://github.com/letyo/plumbing-services-backend/tree/main
